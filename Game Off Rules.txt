# "GAME OFF" - January 2026

THEME: "One Button Away"

**Prize Pool:** $300 (winner takes all)
**Duration:** NOW → Wednesday 11:59pm CT
**Format:** Solo developers, 20 hours maximum
---
## The Rules

### Time
- You have **20 hours total** to build your game
- Spread them however you like across the week
- **Dev Log Required**: Post daily updates in Discord with:
  - Hours worked today
  - Cumulative total
  - What you accomplished
- Honor system - we trust you

### Tools & Assets
- **Any engine**: Unity, Godot, Unreal, GameMaker, or web (React, plain JS, etc.)
- **AI tools allowed**: Code generation, art generation, music - go wild
- **External assets allowed**: Free asset packs are fine, just credit them
- **Templates OK**: Your personal boilerplate is fine, but no pre-made games

### What to Submit
- Playable build (Windows or web)
- Source code on GitHub
- README with: controls, how to play, credits
- Dev log summary: total hours, major milestones

### Version Control
- **Commit your work to GitHub** when finishing each session
- If you need help with Git/GitHub, let me know - it's easy to learn before we start

### Scope Advice
- **Aim for 5-10 minutes** of core gameplay
- A polished small game beats an ambitious broken one
- Get your "minimum viable game" working first, then add features

## Tiebreaker
