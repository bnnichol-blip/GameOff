## Response to Other Models
I have reviewed iteration 2 of the PLAN.md, which now incorporates feedback from Claude, Codex, and myself. 

## New Concerns
None.

## What Works Well
- **Comprehensive detail** — The plan now explicitly covers edge cases like landing logic, input gating, and crater math, which will significantly reduce bugs during implementation.
- **Improved structure** — The inclusion of helper functions like `getCurrentRound()` and `updateTankPhysics()` makes the logic much clearer.
- **Visual Feedback** — The added 800ms delay and input gating by phase ensure a professional-feeling turn-based experience.

## My Verdict
ALIGNED - I approve this plan. All previous suggestions have been addressed. Let's build it!
